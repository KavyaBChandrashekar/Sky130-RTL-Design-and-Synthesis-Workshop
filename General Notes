General Notes for quick view on the 5-day Workshop

Day 1:
- Intro to general flow of simulation and synthesis
- Remote server virtual machine to access the linux platform
- Intro to iverilog simulator, gtkwave waveform viewer
- Intro to yosys open source tool for synthesis
- Intro to github and cloning and accessing the repositories
- Labs to run iverilog for simulating good and bad designs and viewing waveforms
- VCD dump
- Labs to run yosys with std cell libraries imported from the github repos
- Visualization of the netlist using dot files


Commands:
iverilog <rtl file> <testbench file>
./a.out
gtkwave <VCD file>

yosys                         //invokes YOSys
read_verilog <design file>
read_liberty -lib <.lib file>
synth -top <design name>      //decide what part of the whole design you want to synthesize (can do the whole top module or indiv. submodules)

dfflibmap -liberty <path to lib file>
   //use this while synthesizing seq ckts with DFFs.

   //*optional for flattened netlist
flatten
   //*optional optimize
opt_clean -purge              //for optimization. For mult modules, first flatten and then do opt_clean...
abc -liberty <design name>    //linking design to library
show                          // graphical representation of the netlist
write_verilog -noattr <netlist file name.v>       //no attr removes all the extra lines and provides only those with std cells
!gvim <the above given netlist file name.v>

exit                          //exits yosys and goes back to shell
