Day 2

Exploring the .lib file - what it contains, what is the significance
PVT - Process, Voltage and Temp
** tt means typical
- for each cell, for combination of the inputs, there is a specific value for area, power and delay
- wider cells have lesser delay but consume more area and power

Hierarchical and flattened synthesis

synth -top <module>  vs synth -top <submodule>
 -- we use submodule level synthesis when 
  1. We have multiple instances of the same submodule in the top module. So just synth once and then replicate to save time and effort
  2. When we have a huge design, we can synthesize each submodule separately and get its more manageable netlist, and then stitch it together to get the top level netlist optimized.
  
flattened netlist visualization shows the details of the internal logic cells used.
hierarchical netlist only shows submodule names, not the internal logic.
