Day 2

Exploring the .lib file - what it contains, what is the significance

Hierarchical and flattened synthesis

synth -top <module>  vs synth -top <submodule>
 -- we use submodule level synthesis when 
  1. We have multiple instances of the same submodule in the top module. So just synth once and then replicate to save time and effort
  2. When we have a huge design, we can synthesize each submodule separately and get its more manageable netlist, and then stitch it together to get the top level netlist optimized.
